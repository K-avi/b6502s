## B6502S 

todo : 
    
    - implement proper error handling
    - I *could* use macro to create the opcode functions but I think 
      it's a bad idea 
    - I *should* however prolly use a single function to set flags and 
      make the code somewhat less boilerplaty

VERY EARLY / WIP nothing is implemented yet

B6502S is a Basic (as in simple not the language) 6502 SoC Simulator. 

The goal of this project is to help me learn 6502 assembly and also to make a neat little 
SoC Simulator (which is pretty cool I think). 

ATM the project is in it's very early stage. 
I'm really busy bc of college so I probably won't make very fast progress. 

My goal is to implement a fully functionnal and somewhat realistic simulator 
of a 6502 computer (not just a simple VM). 

I'll also make a custom assembler program on another repo 
to translate 6502 asm to actual machine code if I can.

I got interrested in retro computing recently and I wanted to make 
a project related to the topic :-)
